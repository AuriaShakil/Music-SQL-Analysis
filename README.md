# Music-SQL-Analysis

🎵 **SQL-based analysis** of the WSDA Music database, exploring song metadata, artist popularity, and genre trends through queries, aggregations, and visual insights. This project demonstrates how relational database queries can uncover trends in the music industry.

🚧 **Project in Progress** – Outputs and visualizations will be added in future updates.

## 📊 Project Overview
Using the WSDA Music database, this project:
- Analyzes artist popularity based on total plays or streams
- Examines genre distribution and popularity trends over time
- Identifies top artists and albums by various metrics
- Calculates average song duration per genre and year
- Generates visualizations for trends and comparisons

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **SQL** (SQLite via DB Browser for SQLite)
- **Data Visualization**: Excel / Power BI / Tableau (optional)
- **GitHub** for version control and documentation

## 🧪 Methodology
1. **Data Exploration** – Investigated database schema and relationships between tables.
2. **Query Development** – Wrote SQL queries to answer analytical questions.
3. **Aggregation & Filtering** – Used SQL functions (`SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`, `GROUP BY`, etc.) to extract insights.
4. **Visualization** – Exported query results for visual representation of trends.

## 📁 Project Structure
- `WSDA_Music.db` – Main database file
- `queries/` – Folder containing `.sql` files for each query
- `output/` – CSV exports, charts, and visualizations
- `README.md` – Project documentation

## 📈 Example Queries
- Top 10 most popular artists by total streams
- Average song duration by genre
- Yearly trend of songs released
- Artists with the highest album counts
- Genre popularity comparison

## 📂 Dataset
The database file used in this project is [`WSDA_Music.db`](./WSDA_Music.db).  
A CSV version of the database and CSV exports of query results will be added in future updates.

## ✅ Conclusion
This project shows how SQL queries can be used to derive insights from structured music data, helping to answer key questions about artist success, song trends, and genre performance.
