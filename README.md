- Detailed breakdown includes Latin, Metal, and other genres by year. 


### **Project 3 ‚Äì Customer Segmentation by Spending Behavior**  
**Goal:** Segment customers into top spenders and low spenders.  
**Business Impact:** Supports loyalty program development and personalized promotions for high-value customers.  
**Technical Skills Used:** `LEFT JOIN` to include zero-spend customers, `JOIN` for matching customers with invoices, `COUNT(DISTINCT ...)` for orders, `SUM()` and `AVG()` for spend metrics, `ROUND()` for formatting, `ORDER BY` spend/orders, `LIMIT` for top results.  

**Queries:**  
- [project3_top_spending_customers.sql](queries/project3_top_spending_customers.sql)  
- [project3_low_spending_customers.sql](queries/project3_low_spending_customers.sql)  

**Outputs:**  
- [project3_low_spending_customers.csv](output/project3_low_spending_customers.csv)  
- [project3_top_spending_customers.csv](output/project3_top_spending_customers.csv

**Sample Output Highlights:**
- **Low Spenders:** Example ‚Äì *Puja Srivastava* (India) spent $36.64 over 6 orders, average $6.11/order  
- **Top Spenders:** Example ‚Äì *John Doeein* spent $1000.86 in a single order  
- Insights help target loyalty programs and upselling opportunities.   
  

### **Project 4 ‚Äì Track Popularity vs. Price Elasticity**  
**Goal:** Analyze the correlation between track price and total sales.  
**Business Impact:** Informs optimal pricing strategies to maximize revenue without reducing demand.  
**Technical Skills Used:** `JOIN` for linking sales to track details, `SUM()` for total units sold, `GROUP BY` track name and price, `ORDER BY` units sold.

**Query:**  
- [project4_track_price_vs_sales.sql](queries/project4_track_price_vs_sales.sql)  

**Output:**  
- [project4_track_price_vs_sales.csv](output/project4_track_price_vs_sales.csv)
  
**Sample Output Highlights:**
- Tracks like *Latlux* and *Tres-Zap* priced at $0.99 sold 19 units each  
- Identifies the balance point between price and sales volume.  


### **Project 5 ‚Äì Playlist Influence on Sales**  
**Goal:** Compare sales for tracks in playlists vs. not in playlists and rank top-performing playlists.  
**Business Impact:** Validates the role of curated playlists as a driver for music sales and audience engagement.  
**Technical Skills Used:** `CASE WHEN EXISTS` for conditional grouping, nested subqueries, `COUNT(DISTINCT ...)`, `SUM()` for revenue/units, `ROUND()` for formatting, multiple `JOIN`s across playlist/track/sales tables, division with `NULLIF` for per-track metrics, `ORDER BY` revenue/units.

**Queries:**  
- [project5_playlist_influence_overall.sql](queries/project5_playlist_influence_overall.sql)  
- [project5_top_playlists_by_sales.sql](queries/project5_top_playlists_by_sales.sql)

- [project5_playlist_influence_overall.csv](output/project5_playlist_influence_overall.csv)  
- [project5_top_playlists_by_sales.csv](output/project5_top_playlists_by_sales.csv)
  
**Sample Output Highlights:**
- Tracks **in playlists** generated $2,328.60 revenue from 2,240 units  
- **Top Playlist:** *Music* ‚Äì 3,290 tracks, 2,129 units sold, $2,107.71 revenue  
- Confirms playlists drive higher engagement and sales.
